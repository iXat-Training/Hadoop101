Please note that the course is still in progress, visit again to see updated content._\r\n\r\n* ### Building Hadoop on windows, the required steps and softwares are elobarated in the readme.\r\n\r\n* ### HDFS Examples on a Windows Hadoop Node    \r\n\r\n* ### Maven based Java client for reading off an HDFS running in a VBox-CentOS based Hadoop Pseudo-Dist node\r\n\r\n* ### A Maven project for analyzing stock trades that have happened on given set of stocks data (live from Google finance), the application also demonstrates how to use maven for building a Hadoop Job Jar.\r\n\r\n* ### Yarn theory and demonstration of a non-MR application on a YARN cluster\r\n\r\n* ### Application to demonstrate JobChaining, ToolRunner and Custom Counters    \r\n\r\n* ### Deriving an InvertedIndex on StackOverflow posts and different types of Joins\r\n\r\n* ### Some assignments for the weekend :-)\r\n\r\n* ### Samples to demonstrates inputformats and custom input format to read from XML HDFS input\r\n\r\n* ### Pig Intro and a Pig Reference \r\n\r\n* ### Pig examples with params, projection, grouping and Joins    \r\n\r\n* ### Pig UDF to extract weekday from a string date, extension to our stock data\r\n\r\n* ### Hive intro, setup, create table, sort and grouping\r\n\r\n* ### Hive samples with dynamic partition examples.\r\n\r\n* ### UDF in Hive    \r\n\r\n* ### Apache drill intro and samples queries, used Tableu for visualization\r\n\r\n* ### Flume Intro\r\n\r\n* ### Assignment on Twitter sentiment analytics using Twitter4J, Flume, HDFS, Drill, Stanford NLP.\r\n\r\n    1 ### Store the Twitter feeds partitioned by Date and Hour in HDFS, a sample Flume Twitter Source is provided for your reference. \r\n\r\n    2 ### Twitter content is usually an OR of keywords provided in the FilterQuery, derive a logical AND of tweets on the provided keywords\r\n\r\n    3 ### Twitter content over a period of time can result in multiple small files in HDFS, All historical Twitter (Current Day - 1) feeds need to be consolidated a bigger files (of size 64MB) and stored in HDFS.\r\n\r\n    4 ### Do a sentiment analysis of Tweets using Stanford NLP (example provided)\r\n\r\n    5 ### Generate a Timeseries graph (or a scatter) in Tableu on the sentiment score and with count of tweets.\r\n\r\n    6 ### Write a utility which would take hour of the day as input and displays all the possible sentiment scores and #count of tweets for that hour. When given a sentiment score and hour, the utility should fetch all originall tweets which fall in this criteria.\r\n\r\n    7 ### Use Tableu for visualization.\r\n\r\n* ### Avro introduction, demonstrate projection and evolution. Also, there is a C# test which reads off an avro file generated from java\r\n\r\n* ### ZooKeeper samples, using a quorum with watchers. Also, there is a sample which uses Curator f/w for Zookeeper.\r\n     1 A Zookeeper Client with watcher\r\n\r\n     2 Zookeeper Client for a Quorum\r\n\r\n     3 Curator sample\r\n\r\n     4 NodeJS application to set watch and set data in a quorum\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Hadoop training @ Hyderabad, IXAT Solutions, Kukatpally, Hyderabad 2016\r\n","google":"UA-72613811-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
